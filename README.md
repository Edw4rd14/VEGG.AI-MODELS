<b>Description:</b>

This is my repository for model building for the models utilized in Vegg.AI's vegetable classification. The models were hosted on Render. This was done as a part of my Devops and AI Automation assignment.

<b>Guide on setting up model notebook, model.ipynb:</b>
- Clone this local repository into your machine.
- Obtain the testing image folder if possible for evaluation (otherwise you could skip the evaluations)
- Next, redirect your Git Bash terminal to the folder <i>vegg.ai-models</i>.
- In you Git Bash terminal, run <i><b>python -m venv env</b></i> to create the virtual environment, followed by <i><b>source ./env/bin/activate</b></i> to activate the virtual environment.
- To install the dependencies for this notebook, run <i><b>pip install -r requirements.txt</b></i>.
- With that, you can run the model.ipynb to obtain the most updated models.
